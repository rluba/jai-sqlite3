# jai-sqlite3

This is just a simple example of how to use Jaiâ€™s Bindings_Generator module to auto-generate Jai glue-code for existing libraries.

* Run `jai generate.jai` to re-generate the bindings for your platform.
* `test.jai` contains a translated copy of the simplest sqlite3 program from their documentation page.
